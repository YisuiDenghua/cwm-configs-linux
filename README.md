### ¡¡Impurity Warning!!

My catppucchin themed CWM config (on Linux)

requirements:

```
cwm
alacritty
polybar
feh
pulseaudio
light
picom
dmenu
```
Currently I don't know how to configure polybar so my polybar is empty 😢. If you have good ideas, please feel free to open Issue or PRs! Thanks a lot. ❤️
